# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
length=5
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width=3
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
area=length*width
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
print("\nThe result of the area is",area)

print(f'\nthe result is {area}')

# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables. 
print("\nIf the length of the rectangle is:", length, "\nand width is:", width, "\nthen the area is:", area)

print(f"\nif the length of a rectangle is {length}, \nand the width is {width}, \nthen the area is: {area}")
